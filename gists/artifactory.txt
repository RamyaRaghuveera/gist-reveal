      <li>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to take applications and services that are highly repeatable and deploy them to a typical Kubernetes cluster.</li><br>
      <li>Package managers automate the process of installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing computer programs.</li><br>
      <li>A Helm chart defines several Kubernetes resources as a set. A default chart has a minimum of a deployment template and a service template.</li><br>

        <li>One of the Develop practices is to automate continuous delivery through a delivery pipeline, in part by using an artifact repository for storing output of the build stage.</li><br>
        <li>The Developer Environment uses Artifactory as an artifact repository manager, which it uses to host its Helm repository.</li><br>
        <li>JFrog Artifactory is the Universal Artifactory Manager.</li></br>
        <li>Artifactory is an artifact management repository</li><br>
        <li>Artifactory can be deployed anywhere it be on-prem,cloud or any hybrid cloud.</li><br>

        <li>Artifactory manager often acts as the storage for package managers like Maven,npm,pip,helm.</li><br>
        <li>An artifact repository manager hosts multiple binary repositories, like a database management system for artifacts. </li><br>
        <li>The binary repository compliments the source code repository: the code from an SCM is the input to the build process, whereas a binary repository stores the output of the build process, often called artifacts.</li><br>
        <li>The artifacts are often individual application components that can later be assembled into a full product.</li><br>
        <li>An artifact repository manager is an integral part of a CI/CD solution, a companion to the pipeline. As the pipeline builds artifacts, theyâ€™re stored in the repositories.</li><br>
